Soul Eater
Wherever have you wandered this time? You certainly can't stay for long... 

As a lantern-bearing pilgrim in a world of the damned, time is not your friend. 
You do carry, but that isn't uncommon in lands like these so others are likely to follow suit. At the moment you only carry your lantern, of which you can blind those who come too close.
To truly survive this place you must consume the souls of those lost to this world, to feed your lantern for however time you have left.
Alas scavengers like you never stray far from those responsible for leaving such a supply...

You have entered the lands of Woodfolk, of which there is no quarter. Your kind has been here before, and here you are likely to remain.
Consume those before you, Soul Eater.
